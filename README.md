# PlayerTime
This Minecraft based plugin counts players play-time across multiple servers using a centralised MySQL Database.
MySQL options are configured within a flat file, as well as a few additional configuration options.
The plugin also has a few additional features such as giving tokens to users after 10 minutes as well as a booster option allowing players to activate boosters for that server multiplying the amount of tokens they get per 10 minutes.
The plugin has been written in Java using the Minecrafts API.
